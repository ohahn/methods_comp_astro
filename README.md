Source code accompanying the course "Methods of Computational Astrophysics" by Oliver Hahn for MSc students in astrophysics and computational science at the University of Vienna. Note that most source code is not provided via github, but only listed in the lecture notes. Provided here are only longer code pieces and is a mixture of python source files and jupyter notebooks. The code has been tested to run with Python 3.10 and may require various packages to be installed. The code is provided as is, without any guarantees.
